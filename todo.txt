Sunday		25.12.2016:
	Day off


General:
	Add maoubot to my local accounts collection. 
	Test if all projects still work with the TAG change.
		YES: be happy
		NO:	Either delete the project or fix it. (prob. deleting would be better, since there is so much useless stuff...)
	Move stuff to github issues? Maybe even use github projects?
		Not really usefull for now, since only I am currently working on this project. Maybe later.

TwitchSharp:
	Create a new XmlManager that allows the user to pass the current type as class argument. 
		XmlManager<T_> xml = new XmlManager<T_>
	Move the TAG CAP REQ before joining a channel.


Maoubot-GUI:
	TextCommands:
		Add combobox to select textcommands,
		allow changing, deleting and executing.
		add textbox and an "add" button to add new textcommand without doing it via chat.
		Maybe display a ? icon for the variables people can use.

		Permissions?
			USER -> SUB -> MOD -> BROADCASTER
			+ would stop spam, not sure if I should add a cooldown system thoo. 
				implement it into the Textcommand class?
				mods+ would ignore this timeout.
				staff, gmod, count as mods.
				admins count as broadcaster.

		Variables:
			%nick%		Users nickname
			%time%		current time.
			%color%		Users color
			%role%		Users role(s)? Not sure if that's useful.. 
	
	Standart commands, 
		quotes? :D

	Subscription helper:
		Enable/Disable checkbox -> Config
		Define a custom message, without changing the code. Make sure to add a \s after the message so twitch allows the "spam"
